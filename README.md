Most of the revenue being earned in the first 4 weeks of the launch was from businesses in Manhattan. Revenue in Brooklyn and Queens was very low in comparison.

Manhattan restaurants also have the highest average order value (AOV).

Part of this may be due to Manhattan restaurants making up the majority of the businesses on the app and leading when it comes to the variety of restaurants on the app.

Additionally, revenue can potentially be increased by attracting more businesses that have high growth potential due to either high customer demand and/or high AOV.
