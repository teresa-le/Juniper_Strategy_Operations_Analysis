## Results

Most of the revenue being earned in the first 4 weeks of the launch was from businesses in Manhattan. Revenue in Brooklyn and Queens was very low in comparison.

Manhattan restaurants also have the highest average order value (AOV).

Part of this may be due to Manhattan restaurants making up the majority of the businesses on the app and leading when it comes to the variety of restaurants on the app.

Additionally, revenue can potentially be increased by attracting more businesses that have high growth potential due to either high customer demand and/or high AOV. 

## Summary 

To increase the revenue of Juniper in NYC, the following strategy can be implemented: 
<ol> 
  <li> Expand number of restaurants across leading cuisine categories in Manhattan to increase revenue. If the top 4 cuisine categories grew by 50% (volume),   monthly revenue would increase by ~$18k or a 15% total monthly revenue increase, keeping AOV constant. </li>
  <li> Growing merchant base in Brooklyn, both in quantity and variety. If we double the number of pickup places and increase AOV by only 25% (= Manhattanâ€™s) there would be  ~2.3x of monthly revenue in Brooklyn. (~$8.2K vs $3.5k today). </li>
  <li> Begin developing future considerations for a soft launch in Queens based on areas of success in Brooklyn. </li>
</ol>
